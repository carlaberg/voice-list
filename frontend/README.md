# You just name it and it ends up on a list!

## To notice:

- Queries are stored in /queries for easy reause and to avoid bloating the component code.
  Babel-plugin-import-graphql is used for importing them into the components. If you make a change to
  a query you need to rerun "npm run dev" in order for the changes to take affect.
